# ML/LLM Custom Kernel

Welcome to the **ML/LLM Custom Kernel**, a high-performance operating system kernel designed explicitly for machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) development. This kernel integrates advanced ML libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow) using C/C++ to offer unparalleled speed, resource management, and direct hardware utilization. It includes a comprehensive API for developers, providing direct access to optimized kernel-level operations.

## Features

- **Optimized Tensor and Matrix Operations**: Direct kernel support for high-speed tensor computations, leveraging GPU, TPU, and other hardware accelerators.
- **Integrated PyTorch and TensorFlow**: Built-in integration using C/C++ APIs for rapid training, inference, and model management.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Smart hardware allocation across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs to maximize resource utilization.
- **Zero-Copy Data Transfer**: Efficient data movement between kernel space and user space without intermediate copying, enhancing performance.
- **Kernel-Level Model Management**: Manage ML model lifecycle (loading, saving, training, inference) directly from the kernel for improved speed and efficiency.
- **API Access**: A versatile API to interact with kernel functionalities, supporting multiple languages and remote communication.
- **Security and Privacy**: Real-time data encryption, access control, and confidential computing support for safe model training and data processing.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Access real-time hardware usage, training status, and resource metrics through the kernel API.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Compatible hardware (x86_64, ARM, etc.) with GPU/TPU for optimal performance.
- At least 8 GB of RAM (16 GB or more recommended for large models).
- An active internet connection for downloading dependencies.

### Building the Kernel
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/goldenhippo58/zernel.git
   cd ml-kernel
   ```

2. **Compile the Kernel:**
   - Ensure you have a C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) and necessary build tools installed.
   - Run the build script:
     ```bash
     ./build_kernel.sh
     ```
   - The kernel will be compiled with integrated PyTorch and TensorFlow libraries.

3. **Install the Kernel:**
   - Copy the compiled kernel and modules to your boot directory:
     ```bash
     sudo cp ./build/output/kernel.img /boot/
     sudo cp -r ./build/modules/ /lib/modules/
     ```

4. **Update Bootloader:**
   - Update your bootloader configuration (e.g., GRUB) to include the new kernel.
   - Reboot your system to start using the custom ML/LLM kernel.

## Usage

### API Usage
The kernel exposes a comprehensive API for interacting with its ML and LLM capabilities. You can access the API using the provided language bindings (C++, Python, etc.).

1. **Include the kernel API in your C++ program:**
   ```cpp
   #include <kernel_api.h>

   int main() {
       // Initialize the kernel API
       KernelAPI kernel;

       // Create a tensor
       Tensor tensor = kernel.create_tensor({3, 3});

       // Run a matrix multiplication
       Tensor result = kernel.matrix_multiply(tensor, tensor);
       
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Python API Example:**
   ```python
   import ml_llm_kernel_api as kernel

   # Initialize the kernel API
   api = kernel.KernelAPI()

   # Load a model
   model = api.load_model('/path/to/model')

   # Run inference
   output = api.run_inference(model, input_data)
   ```

## API Overview

### Core Operations
- **create_tensor(dimensions)**: Create a new tensor with the specified dimensions.
- **matrix_multiply(tensor1, tensor2)**: Perform matrix multiplication between two tensors.
- **tensor_operations(tensor, operation)**: Execute element-wise tensor operations (e.g., addition, subtraction).

### Memory and Resource Management
- **allocate_memory(size)**: Allocate kernel-managed memory for tensors or data buffers.
- **shared_memory_buffer()**: Create a shared memory buffer for efficient data exchange.

### Model Management
- **load_model(model_path)**: Load a pre-trained model into kernel space.
- **save_model(model, destination_path)**: Save a model from kernel space to disk.
- **run_inference(model, input_data)**: Execute inference using a loaded model.

### Training and Inference
- **start_training(model, dataset)**: Begin a training session with the specified model and dataset.
- **pause_training(session_id)**: Pause a running training session.
- **resume_training(session_id)**: Resume a previously paused training session.
- **get_training_status(session_id)**: Retrieve real-time status and metrics of an ongoing training session.

## Examples

### C++: Matrix Multiplication
```cpp
#include <kernel_api.h>

int main() {
    KernelAPI kernel;
    Tensor tensor1 = kernel.create_tensor({3, 3});
    Tensor tensor2 = kernel.create_tensor({3, 3});
    
    Tensor result = kernel.matrix_multiply(tensor1, tensor2);
    // Use result...
    return 0;
}
```

### Python: Model Inference
```python
import ml_llm_kernel_api as kernel

api = kernel.KernelAPI()
model = api.load_model('/path/to/model')
output = api.run_inference(model, input_data)
print(output)
```
